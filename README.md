Yet another photo application. This is my first application to learn how to develop in android 

The project is supposed to run under the android sdk based on eclipse.

The application is divided in two main part Albums and Events. Each album is a container of zero or more events and each event can below to zero or more album.

An album is identified by a title and a picture.

At the moment only the album part has been developed providing these features:
1. create an album with a title and or a picture
2. store the picture in the phone
3. delete or update the album

Future improvements are the implementation of the Event management section and providing cloud storage and sharing
